Need to manage the payroll for a company with employees and managers? 
This is the right solution for you where you (as the admin) and your subordinates can do the following :
- Employees/managers/admin log in to and log out from the system
- Employees/managers/admin view their profile
- Employees/managers/admin modify their own profile details
- Employees/managers/admin reset their own password when they forgot. (New)
- Employees/manager submit their time card information
- Employees/manager submit their sale receipts 
- Employees/manager submit their feedback form
- Employees/manager/admin view the profile of others
- Employee/manager view their own payment history
- Managers/admin get notified of their subordinate feedbacks and uploads
- Managers/admin validate subordinate uploaded timecards and sales receipts
- Managers/admin view their subordinate feedbacks
- Managers add an available employee / manager to their team
- Managers remove their subordinates from their team
- Admin creates a new employee / manager
- Admin removes an employee / manager record
